    "description": "This is the profile for a painkiller, which is the generic term we use for a consumable, quick-healing item. Being able to quickly heal a number of wounds is important to the system; it lets you keep your character moving when they would otherwise be eliminated, and it tempers the lethality of combat. Although these items mechanically heal wounds, thematically they can help your character get back on their feet in any number of ways, depending on the setting. In a {@setting fantasy} setting, these may be {@i healing potions} that use magic to heal injuries. In the {@setting steampunk} setting, they may be {@i healing tonics} that rely on some ill-understood scientific or alchemical properties. The {@setting weird war} setting can use {@i aid packs} that are either scientific or magical. A {@setting modern day} setting treats these as {@i painkillers}, allowing your character to ignore minor injuries and keep going. {@setting Science fiction} or {@setting space opera} settings could also use painkillers, or they could use {@i autohealers} that rely on futuristic medicine or even nanotechnology to patch up injuries in moments. Whatever the name, painkillers work the same way in the game mechanics for every setting. Using a painkiller requires one maneuver for your character to apply it either to themself or to another engaged character. The painkiller is consumed in the process, and the character immediately heals 5 wounds. While a character can use multiple painkillers, this provides diminishing returns. Each painkiller after the first heals one wound fewer. A second painkiller heals 4 wounds, a third heals 3, and so on. Using a sixth painkiller in a day has no further effect. After one day, the lingering effects of the painkillers wear off, and the character may use painkillers again with their normal effect (this means a character can consume up to five painkillers a day, each day). See page 116 for more information on painkillers and healing.",

The profile is general enough that this could work for a knife carried in the belt of a medieval noble, a weapon bought at a sporting goods store today, or part of the gear of an interstellar soldier of the future. Since the weapon is a Melee weapon, it uses the {@skill Melee} skill. The damage it can deal depends on the Brawn of the user, so it has a \"+\" next to the damage entry to signify that you'd add your character's Brawn rating to the number to figure out its base damage. +1 damage means it does not do a great deal of damage, which is appropriate for a knife. A Crit rating of 3 is what we consider our \"average\" Crit value. Rolling {@symbols aaa} on a check is not too unlikely for a skilled user. And because this is a close combat weapon, it can only be used against enemies your character is engaged with (hence the range of \"engaged\"). A knife is small, so we gave it an encumbrance value of 1. A knife is cheap and easy to find, hence the inexpensive price and low rarity. It also has no special item qualities, because again, it's a simple knife.",

Like the knife's, this profile is general enough that it could work for a sixshooter out of the 1800s, a sidearm in a steampunk universe, or something straight out of our own era. The weapon is a Ranged weapon, hence it uses the {@skill Ranged} skill. Of course, if your setting breaks up {@skill Ranged} into multiple skills, this would probably use {@skill Ranged (Light)} since it's a pistol used in one hand. The damage reflects this: good damage for a pistol, but not comparable to a military rifle's. The same goes for the Crit rating. Rolling {@symbols aaaa} on a check is a bit less likely, so it's going to take a skilled shot to make this weapon effective. We gave this a range of medium, which is typically the maximum range for pistols (some pistols are only useful at short range). The weapon's a bit bigger and bulkier than the knife, hence the higher encumbrance value of 2. Its cost reflects the higher cost of firearms, but it should still be fairly easy to find one. It also has one item quality, since revolvers tend to be accurate sidearms. You may be surprised that we didn't give it the {@quality Limited Ammo|Limited Ammo 6} quality (for its six shots). However, we find in games that combat encounters tend to average around three to five rounds. If a weapon is unlikely to run out of ammo before combat ends, we recommend that it's not worth tracking ammo and that you should use the rules in the {@sidebar Tracking Ammo} sidebar on page 89.",

Unlike a Gatling gun, though, a rotor pistol isn't hand cranked; it is fired with a pull of the trigger. This is achieved by means of a quartz-galvanite battery that unleashes a single strong pulse of electricity that sends the gun's mechanisms into motion. After firing, you have to not only completely reload the internal magazine of the pistol, but also replace the battery. The {@quality Limited Ammo} quality doesn't mean a rotor pistol only holds one bullet, of course, but that a single burst of fire consumes all its ammunition.",

They are popular among criminals, police, and special forces operators the world over. The SMG presented in {@table II.4-1: Modern Weapons} on page 166 is a typical 9mm weapon that might be used by a metropolitan police force or carried by a drug lord's bodyguard. It deals the same damage as a light pistol, since they share calibers. It can fire full auto, so it has the {@quality Auto-fire} quality. Even when it doesn't fire on full auto, we imagine each \"shot\" is actually several bullets, and so we gave it a lower Critical rating to represent the sheer amount of lead it puts in the air.",
